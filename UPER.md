<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>

<p>Create RESTful API and connect it with React app built for Capstone-1: </p>
<p>Data is currently in a .json file and must be added to a database </p>
<p>Data should be restructured to follow database modeling best practices </p>
<p>API should have data persistence layer</p>
<p>Front-end must be refactored to be effectively wired up with API</p>
<p> Front-end does not currently allow for different users, which may be desired and should be considered when creating database model</p>
<p>API should contain full CRUD functionality with appropriate status codes </p>
&nbsp; -Determine which components require API calls (search, add-to-cart, etc.)
<p>API should include completed cardinality between entities </p>

<h2>2. Planning the Solution </h2>
<p>Create DB Schema diagram</p>
<p>Create database (AWS RDS)</p>
<p>Clone Capstone-3 repo and add Maven framework and Spring dependencies</p>
<p>Add datasource to project (AWS RDS database - make sure it is publicly available)</p>
<p>Create entities and implement cardinality</p>
<p>Create .sql file that adds all product data to database (data persistence layer)</p>
<p>Add CRUD functionality by creating repositories, services, and controllers(include status codes)</p>
<p>Test HTTP requests using Insomnia</p>
<p>Once functional, create API documentation</p>

<p>Add API calls to context provider (ProductContext)</p>
<p>If property names in API match property names in data.json file, app should be working correctly</p>
<p>Delete data.json file</p>
